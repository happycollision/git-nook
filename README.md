# git-nook

**Git for a sub directory you don't want others to deal with.**

`git-nook` gives a directory of files real git tracking — status, commits,
diffs, log, branches, merges, conflicts, push, pull — even when the host
repo cannot or should not track them itself. Each tracked directory (a
"nook") is backed by a genuine git repository hidden inside the host repo's
`.git/`, and published to custom refs that appear in no branch listing, no
host web UI, and no default clone. Once a nook exists, every day-to-day
operation is a plain git command you already know; the tool's only jobs are
creating nooks and handing your git invocations to the right one.

When you add a nook, you don't have to also PR a new line in `.gitignore`.
Instead, `git-nook` updates your local `.git/info/exclude` and you can get to
work instead of do the PR song and dance.

This is ideal for your personal IDE settings, planning documents, or anything
that is specific to you and not something you want to foist upon your
collaborators.

Nooks can be stored at the origin of the repo your are working on, or you can
go fully external and point your Nook's upstream at any repo you have write
access for.

## Install

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/happycollision/git-nook/master/install.sh | bash
```

This installs `git-nook` to `~/.local/bin/git-nook` (override with
`GIT_NOOK_INSTALL_PATH`), making it callable as `git nook` anywhere git looks
for subcommands on your `PATH`. Running the one-liner again upgrades it in
place.

From a checkout of this repo, run the local copy instead of downloading a
release:

```sh
./install.sh
```

### Versioning

`git nook --version` reports what it was built from: `git-nook vX.Y.Z` for
a tagged release, `git-nook post-vX.Y.Z-dev` for a checkout or install
built on top of release `X.Y.Z` (i.e. master since that release), and
`git-nook v0.0.0-dev` only for raw, un-stamped source. The version string
is stamped into the installed copy at install/release time; the committed
source itself is never mutated.

## Quick start

```sh
git nook init notes origin
```

This creates a hidden inner git repository for a nook named `notes`, assigns
it an immutable identity, wires its remote to custom refs on `origin`, and
gives you the nook's files at `notes/` (a symlink into the shared checkout,
excluded from the host repo via `.git/info/exclude`, so `git status` in the
host repo never mentions it). Edit files there like any other directory:

```sh
echo "today's notes" > notes/today.md
git nook -n notes run status
git nook -n notes run add --all
git nook -n notes run commit -m "today's notes"
git nook -n notes run push
```

On another machine (or a fresh clone of the host repo), one command
bootstraps the whole thing — inner repo, exclude entry, and content —
straight from the published refs, for a nook that already exists:

```sh
git nook clone notes origin
```

`clone` fetches the existing nook's history and materializes `notes/`
automatically; there's nothing else to run. (If several nooks on the remote
share the name `notes`, `clone` disambiguates by asking you to pick one — see
"Identity & storage" below.)

After a plain `git clone` of the host repo, the nook's config comes along
but its worktree symlink doesn't — run `git nook materialize` once to link
every configured nook (`notes/` and friends) into the fresh clone.
Likewise, after `git worktree add <path>`, run `git nook materialize`
inside that new worktree to create its symlinks; every worktree then
shares the same underlying nook checkout.

## How it works

A nook is four paths, named after its **slug** (see "Identity & storage"
below), not just its bare name:

```
.git/nook/<slug>.git              # the inner bare repository (hidden inside your .git)
.git/nook/<slug>.nook/            # the container git-nook owns, shared by every worktree
.git/nook/<slug>.nook/notes/      # the real checkout (the work-tree); its basename
                                  #   matches your content dir, so name-sensitive tools
                                  #   (e.g. br's .beads) accept it
notes/                            # a symlink to the work-tree above; excluded via .git/info/exclude
```

The real files live once, in a content directory nested inside the
container at `.git/nook/<slug>.nook/<dir-basename>/` in the host repo's
*common* git dir. That nested directory's name is the basename of your
content dir (`notes`, or `.beads` for `--dir .beads`), so a tool that
resolves the symlink and insists on a particular directory name — like
`br`, which requires a `.beads`/`_beads` directory — sees exactly the name
it expects. Each worktree of the host repo exposes those files
through a plain symlink at the configured path (`notes/` by default) —
the symlink itself, not a directory, is what's excluded via
`.git/info/exclude`, so `git status` in the host repo never mentions it.
Because every worktree's symlink points at the same checkout, `git
worktree add` and any other linked worktree all see the same nook state:
one checkout, one set of refs, one `HEAD`. Run `git nook materialize` in a
worktree that doesn't have the symlink yet (see "Quick start" and
"Commands" below).

`notes/` has no `.git` file of its own — `git nook init`/`clone` never runs a
plain `git init` inside the content dir, so the host repo sees only a
plain excluded symlink: no gitlink, no submodule confusion, no trace that
another repository is involved at all. The inner repository is reachable
only through the wrapper:

```
git nook -n <name> run <any-git-args...>
# ≈ git --git-dir=.git/nook/<slug>.git --work-tree=.git/nook/<slug>.nook/<dir-basename> <any-git-args...>
```

So `git nook -n notes run log -p`, `git nook -n notes run branch`, `git nook -n notes run stash`
— anything git can do — works exactly as it would in a normal checkout.
Local branches, stash, reflog, your merge tool: all available. The one
branch-shaped constraint is that publication is single-ref for content —
`init`/`clone` bake a push refspec that always publishes the inner repo's
`main` branch to one custom ref, so `push`/`pull` and tracking output
(`ahead 1`, `behind 2`) work out of the box without you configuring anything.

Conflicts are ordinary git conflicts: markers land in your working files,
you resolve them with whatever tooling you already use, and you commit the
resolution — no special merge mode, no policy machinery.

## Identity & storage

Every nook gets an immutable UUID the moment it's created. From that UUID,
the name, and the host repo's owner/project, `git-nook` derives a **slug**:
`<name>.<id3>.<owner>.<repo_dir>` (each field has non-alphanumeric characters
mapped to `_`; `<id3>` is the first three characters of the UUID). The slug
— not the bare name — is what's actually used for local dirs
(`.git/nook/<slug>.git`, `.git/nook/<slug>.nook/`), the config key
(`nook.<slug>.dir`), and the published refs. This is why two different repos
(or two nooks in the same repo) can both be called `notes` or `beads` without
colliding: their slugs differ even when their names don't.

`-n <name>` accepts any left-anchored prefix of a slug — a bare unique name
(`-n notes`) works when it's unambiguous, and you disambiguate by typing
further into the slug (`-n notes.a1b.acme`) when it isn't.

Each nook publishes **three refs** on its target remote:

- `refs/nook/<slug>/files` — the nook's actual content, published on your
  first commit + push.
- `refs/nook/<slug>/manifest` — write-once metadata (the full UUID, name,
  and provenance: owner, repo, upstream, user, creation time), published at
  `init`/`clone` time.
- `refs/nook/index` — a derived, rebuildable cache listing every nook on
  that remote, used to disambiguate `clone` by name in a single fetch
  (rebuild it with `git nook reindex` if it goes stale or missing).

Nooks created by the older, pre-slug `add` command use a single flat ref
(`refs/nook/<owner>/<project>/<name>`) and no manifest. `git-nook` detects
these "legacy" nooks and prints a warning; migrating one to the new layout
is a deliberate, manual procedure — see `MIGRATION.md` — and is never done
automatically.

## Choosing a target

`git nook init <name> <target> [--dir <dir>]` — create a fresh nook.
`git nook clone <name> <target> [--dir <dir>]` — adopt an existing nook,
published under that name, from `<target>`.

`<target>` is either the name of an existing remote in the host repo (most
commonly `origin`) or a literal git URL, resolved to a URL once, at
`init`/`clone` time.

- **Same-repo `origin` (the default posture)** — hidden in plain sight.
  Nothing shows up in branch listings or the web UI, but anyone with read
  access to the repo can still discover the refs with `git ls-remote
  origin`. This is the right choice when the goal is keeping clutter out of
  normal git workflows, not restricting who can see the content.
- **A private repo you own** — full access-control separation. Point
  `init`/`clone` at a URL (or a remote name) for a repo whose access list
  you control independently of the host repo's. The host repo stays exactly
  as traceless either way; only the target changes.

`--dir` sets the content directory (default `<name>/`); use it to put a
nook's files somewhere other than the default — including a dotted path
like `--dir .beads` if you'd rather keep it out of a casual `ls`.

## Worked example: hidden issue tracking with beads

A common motivating case: tracking [beads](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust)
(`br`/`bd`) issues for a project without adding a `.beads/` directory to the
project's own git history. Point a nook's content dir straight at `.beads`:

```sh
git nook init beads origin --dir .beads
```

`br` already ships its own `.beads/.gitignore` that excludes local state
(`*.db*`, lock files, daemon files, and so on) — the inner repo honors it
natively, since filtering authority always belongs to the nook's own
`.gitignore`. The one thing worth excluding from tracking entirely is that
`.gitignore` file itself, since `br` regenerates it and syncing it across
machines just invites version churn. Add one line to the *inner* repo's own
exclude file (not the host repo's `.git/info/exclude`, which never applies
here):

```sh
echo .gitignore >> "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)/nook/beads.git/info/exclude"
```

A typical session:

```sh
br sync --flush-only          # flush the local beads DB to issues.jsonl
git nook -n beads run add --all
git nook -n beads run commit -m "issues"
git nook -n beads run pull            # reconcile if another machine pushed since
git nook -n beads run push
```

On a fresh machine, `git nook clone beads origin --dir .beads` bootstraps
`.beads/` from the published refs; run `br init` first if the local `br`
workspace files (config, DB) aren't present yet, then `br sync
--import-only` to load the fetched issues into the local database. If
you're instead cloning a repo that already has the nook configured (or
adding a worktree with `git worktree add`), skip straight to `git nook
materialize` to link `.beads/` into place.

## Prior art

The standard community answers to "track files the host repo can't track"
are: a nested repo in an excluded subdirectory; a separate repo elsewhere
plus symlinks; the classic dotfiles bare-repo trick (`git
--git-dir=<repo> --work-tree=<dir>` behind a shell alias); or a worktree
checked out on a dedicated branch. `git-nook`'s architecture *is* the
bare-repo technique — deliberately, since it's the strongest of the four —
with a few deltas:

- **Remote-side hiding.** The other three approaches still need a second,
  visible repository to push to, which is itself a trace. `git-nook`
  publishes to hidden custom refs on an *existing* remote, even the host's
  own `origin`: no second repo, no branch listing, no UI footprint, same
  transport and credentials you already use.
- **A scoped worktree.** The dotfiles technique sets the whole home
  directory (or repo) as the work-tree and needs
  `status.showUntrackedFiles no` to stay usable, which blinds `status` to
  your own new files and makes `clean` dangerous. A nook's worktree is just
  the content directory, so `status`, `add --all`, and `clean` all behave
  with full fidelity.
- **History survives `git clean -fdx`.** A nested repo's `.git` lives
  inside the host's working tree and dies with an aggressive clean. A
  nook's git-dir lives under the host's own `.git/`, which `clean` never
  touches.
- **One-command setup.** `git nook init`/`clone` encode the whole
  per-machine ritual — exclude entry, byte-identity config, refspecs,
  branch tracking, safety refusals, bootstrap from an existing set of refs —
  that the alias approach leaves as a wiki page for you to remember.

The remaining trade-offs are per-nook choices, not tool limitations:

- **Hidden refs get no host UI.** No web view, no PRs, no CI triggers —
  the `refs/nook/...` refs are custom refs by design, with no
  user-facing option to publish to a normal branch instead.
- **Hidden is not secret.** Anyone with read access to the target can
  `ls-remote` the refs, and nothing is encrypted. When access control
  matters, point `init`/`clone` at a private target you control — see
  "Choosing a target" above.

## Commands

```
git nook init <name> <target-url-or-remote> [--dir <dir>]     # create a fresh nook
git nook clone <name> <target-url-or-remote> [--dir <dir>]    # adopt an existing nook
git nook list
git nook status                  # working-tree state of every nook
git nook materialize             # link configured nooks into this worktree
git nook reindex                 # rebuild the collection index from truth
git nook -n <name> show
git nook -n <name> remove [--force]
git nook -n <name> destroy --yes
git nook -n <name> run <git-args...>    # run any git command against the nook
git nook --help | --version
```

`init` creates and wires a brand-new nook; `clone` fetches and wires an
existing nook published under that name (disambiguating by slug if several
match); `list` shows every nook configured in the current repo (flagging any
that aren't linked into the current worktree, and warning about any legacy,
pre-slug nooks); `status` reports every nook's working-tree state, one line
each, as `<name>: <clean|N changes>, <position> remote` — and exits nonzero if
any nook is broken (missing inner repo, dangling primary home, or not linked
into this worktree), printing the problem in place of that nook's state:

```
$ git nook status
beads: 2 changes, ahead of remote
notes: clean, up to date with remote
```

`-n <name> show` prints its slug, name, uuid, and resolved
checkout path, link state, remote URL, push refspec, and current
branch/tracking state; `-n <name> remove [--force]` fully deletes the nook
*locally* — config, exclude entry, inner git dir, container, and symlink —
refusing if there are unpushed commits unless `--force` is given; it never
touches the upstream. `-n <name> destroy --yes` removes the nook locally
and *also* deletes its published refs on the remote and deindexes it — this
is irreversible and aborts, changing nothing, if it can't reach the remote.
`materialize` creates the missing symlink(s) for already-configured nooks
in the worktree you run it from — use it after `git clone` or after `git
worktree add`; `reindex` rebuilds `refs/nook/index` from every nook's
manifest, for when the index is stale or missing; everything else
(`-n <name> run <git-args...>`) is passthrough git.

## Releasing

Maintainer procedure for cutting a release:

1. Bump the `VERSION` file to the new number (e.g. `0.3.0`) and commit it
   on master.
2. Tag it and push the tag:

   ```sh
   git tag v0.3.0
   git push origin v0.3.0
   ```

   The tag must be `v` + the exact contents of `VERSION`; a mismatch fails
   the release.
3. The tag push triggers the Release workflow, which verifies the tag
   matches `VERSION`, runs shellcheck and the test suite, stamps a clean
   `vX.Y.Z` into a built copy of `bin/git-nook`, generates
   `git-nook.sha256`, and publishes both as a GitHub Release.
4. `install.sh` always fetches the latest published release, so the
   curl one-liner picks up the new version immediately.
5. Until the next bump, master-checkout builds report
   `post-vX.Y.Z-dev` — built on top of the release you just shipped.

Every push to master and every PR also runs shellcheck and the test suite
via CI, independent of releasing.

## Privacy model

`git-nook` hides content from *view*, not from *access*. A hidden ref is
absent from branch listings, host web UIs, and default clones, but it is
still an ordinary ref on whatever remote you targeted — anyone who already
has read access to that remote can enumerate it with `git ls-remote` and
fetch it like any other ref, and nothing about the content is encrypted.
Choose the target accordingly: same-repo `origin` for "keep this out of my
way," a private repo you control for real access-control separation.
